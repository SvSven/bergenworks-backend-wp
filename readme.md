# Bergen.Works Headless WordPress
This WordPress theme is meant to serve as a headless CMS for the Bergen.Works website
The frontend for the Bergen.Works website is built using React/Next.js and can be found [at this repository](https://github.com/SvSven/bergenworks-frontend).

## Plugins
While not dependencies, this theme makes use of the following plugins for the Bergen.Works website:
- [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
Used to create a custom options page and to define several custom fields for specific pages.

These plugins do not come bundled with the theme and need to be installed manually.
